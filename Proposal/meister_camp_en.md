# Camera
We make camera application like 'snow-app'<p>
Our purpose is more fun, flixible camera app used respberry-pi. Our app is like for amart mirror

## Key Features
Meister camp proposal was writed Wonho Ha aka Las<p>
We also used AI, but impliment web

## Used Tech
- Opencv
- CNN
- YOLO
- Raspberry pi

## what's need
- Jupyter notebook
    - Complete
    - Dynamic Programming
- Opencv
    - Process video, and Visualizing that
    - Complete
- Yolo
    - Already read paper
    - We used darknet that pre trained
- CNN
    - Already maked
    - VGG-19
    - VGG-16
    - Google-net
- Programming patten
    - Strategy
    - Object
    - Iterator
    - Factory method
## My skill
- FP
    - Functional programming 
- Tensorflow 
    - for AI
        - Style Transfer
    - CNN
    - ML
    - GAN
- Flask
    - Web server for restful-api-server
- Golang
    - Used server
    - Asigned programming
- Numpy
    - with Opencv, video processing
- Selenium
    - Web controlling
## Study plan
I will study Yolo, and FP. I already make Video processing app. That will be helpful for this project. This project is apply TDD, and Git. We use Jupyter Notebook for more easy programming. specific plan is not necessary. The rough plan is to produce a demo program on my laptop by July. In the meantime, it tests several technologies and checks what is lacking. During this period, I operate AI studies that are supported by Google.
## Specification(can change, XP)
Camera app can detect human-face in real time.<p>
Quick Start
```
python CameraApp.py
>program start
>face circle -color red
```
